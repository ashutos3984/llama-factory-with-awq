He did not take the time to fully explain my results or answer any questions I had about my vision prescription or potential concerns.

The hospital's post-procedural care was decent; the nurses were attentive, and I was given clear instructions on managing pain and diet during recovery. However, the healing process was more painful and longer than I anticipated. The follow-up appointments felt rushed, and I didn't get satisfactory answers to my concerns about lingering pain and difficulty swallowing. While the initial treatment was good, the ongoing care and support during my recovery were lacking, making the entire experience mixed.",

The paramedics were professional and managed my pain well during the ride to the hospital. The surgery itself went smoothly, and I was relieved to be in good hands. However, the post-procedural care left much to be desired. The nurses seemed overworked, and it was challenging to get their attention when I needed assistance. My recovery was slower than expected, partly due to the lack of clear instructions on post-operative care.
