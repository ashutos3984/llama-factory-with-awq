However as soon as I walked into the doors to get started the CMA was rude and seemed to lack empathy that my daughter was ill. Before going back I noticed my daughter felt like she had a fever. When checked the nurse didn't seem to put the thermometer all the way under her arm and her temp read 99 which she said wasn't a fever. My daughter still felt unnaturally warm if not feverish so I asked the provider if she would check again. The provider then told me that it beeps when it's ready to be removed and then proceeded to lay her hand on my child to retake her temperature and not actually use medical equipment. When I got home after my appointment which was just 15 min from the office my daughter had a 101 fever. So I felt very dismissed and felt that the dr did not choose to correct a mistake and care for my daughter but chose to protect the nurse/CMA. Then after my daughter who's been sick for over a week with the flu and now a new illness was upset and crying and screaming over being tested for the flu and strep the provider then said as she was leaving that \" she's glad no one was in the hall to hear my daughter screaming\". I am not one to complain or even argue but I feel as if I was dismissed and that they did not care about my daughter being sick and upset. It would be different if my child was older but she isn't even 2 yet. I'm am distressed and so disappointed in this office and this staff. I expect more from a wellstar facility who says they value their patients. My daughter was let down today. To the point that I will be visiting an urgent care if my daughter doesn't improve by tomorrow morning because at least I feel like I am being heard there than at my own child's general practitioners office.

My big problem was the doctors attitude. I can totally get him having a attitude with me because I wasn't very nice to him. But this doctor needs to take into account that some patients are extremely tired of being brushed off by doctors and it's extremely frustrating. Since I wouldn't speak to the doctor after he came back in the room, my fiance on the other hand is extremely calm and started asking questions on my behalf to better understand the situation. I totally understand not taking anything from patients because unfortunately I used to work in healthcare too. My problem is that my fiance was calmly asking clarifying questions about my condition and he started raising his voice at him and being extremely unprofessional for NO REASON!!! When he was asking why we don't have anything else that we didn't already know he stated in a hostile voice \"YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWERS RIGHT THERE\". The doctor was extremely aggressive with my fiance for no reason which in turn pissed me off even more because he was disrespecting someone who DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. I told him in a extremely calm voice that he needed to leave and get my discharge paperwork. So moral of the story is your doctors DO NOT need to get an attitude with someone who is being nice and trying to get answers. The doctor pissed my fiance off beyond belief with his disrespectful attitude. He has already planned to reach out to management because of this doctors disrespectful behavior towards him. Your doctor just wanted to act unprofessional because he was pissed with me. Which is fine but is uncalled for since my fiance is someone who is just trying to clarify the situation.The man needs to watch his mouth. Another thing is I don't appreciate it being put in my medical records that my condition is \"likely pysicologic\" . That one sentiment is going to ruin any chances of me being taken seriously in the future. It's extremely upsetting because even if I find a doctor who will treat me they will not believe me and just instead send me back to this hell hole. Because they took the time to write that one statement I will never take me seriously again. I'm glad I can always trust well star to ruin everything somehow.
